# Scavenge Chain

### Post secret solution challenges, winners receive token bounty

## Description:
This chain acts like a scavenger hunt. Users can post challenges that come with bounties. The solutoin to the challenge is stored as a hash. To prevent front running when a solution is found, a commit-reveal scheme is used. This chain can act as a temprorary chain that holds real value via IBC.

 * Hashed answers
