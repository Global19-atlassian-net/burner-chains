# CosmWasm Chain

### A blockchain for the [CosmWasm](github.com/cosmwasm) module with smart contracts generated in Rust

## Description:
This blockchain could be the testnet first proposed by [ethanfrey](https://github.com/ethanfrey) in his [blog article](https://github.com/cosmwasm/docs/blob/update-blog/website/blog/2019-11-25-cosmwasm-intro.md) describing CosmWasm. This would be a stable playground for users to try out contract interactions. 

## Possible Features:
 * CosmWasm Module
 * Front end dapp examples that interact with the blockchain
 
## Status: Proposal
 
## Changelog:
 * Initialized 11-12-2019
