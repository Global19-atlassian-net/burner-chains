# Liberal Radicalism DAO

### Short Description

Implement the [liberal radicalism](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3243656) public-goods funding mechanism as a zone.

## Description:

Implement liberal radicalism in the state machine of a sovereign zone, where the funding is provided by native token inflation and contributions
over IBC (token transfers), and the validator slots serve as Sybil-resistant identities (only validators can contribute to proposals & have funds
matched by the central funding pool).

## Possible Features:

* Disburse payments over IBC to other chains
* Allow voting from accounts / validators on other chains over IBC
* UI/UX for proposal creation & funding

## Status

Proposed.

## Changelog

* 3 December 2019 - Initial version
