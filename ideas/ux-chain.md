# UX Chain

### A place for experiments in user-experience and on-boarding

## Description:
The Cosmos-SDK has the opportunity to make a lot of improvements over the current user experience of interacting with a blockchain. We should use this chain to experiment with these interactions and iterate over the best possible user-experience with web3 technology.

## Possible Features:
 * Subkeys
    * Daily Limits
    * Account Recovery
* Gas paid by other addresses
* Sign transactions with alternative keys
    * Google OAuth
    * Various keys
    * 1Password
    * Apple secure enclave
* Name Services
* Frontend features
* Block explorer features
* Pre-paid gas + rate limit
    * Special subey that is allowed to submit transactions with 0 gas * some variably high gas price (still equals 0 but will enable inclusion into blocks)
    * This allows users to pay a subscription fee that enables free transactions for some time period
    * Rate limit would be required to prevent spam attacks
    * Subscription could either be a pre-pay amount that is used to pay actual gas or a flag that enables an account with 0 gas to otherwise make transactions
    * This status should be possible to be enabled by an "admin" account that has received payment in fiat or crypto
