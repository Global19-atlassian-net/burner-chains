# Casino Chain

### Use the [corestar/randapp](https://github.com/corestario/randapp) to make a simple gambling chain

## Description:
With the Distributed Key Generation that takes place on @corestar you are now able to access a random number. This could be used for simple gambling games like dice. As a burner chain you could move over assets via IBC, game with them for a time and then shut the whole thing down.

## Possible Features:
 * [corestar/randapp](https://github.com/corestario/randapp)
 * Simple Dice Game
 * IBC
 
## Status: Proposal
