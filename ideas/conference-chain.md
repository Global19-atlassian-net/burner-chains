# Conference Chain
### Temporary chain used for conferences and events

# Description
Should be useable as a burner wallet for conference attendees to receive food at conferences and events. Should also be the place where other conference specific activities can be built. Possibly a good chain to practice exit strategies, ie. what happens when a chain outlives its purpose? How do you shut a chain down while allowing for meaningful transition of content/value?

# Possible Features
 * Admin minting
 * Temporary IBC
 * Subkeys or other UX focused features for newcomers to blockchain
